# Simple-Currency-Converter
### On my front-end development path, I am facing my third beginner project.
Here I get to do an interesting review of arrays, conditionals, cycles and of course function nesting.
A big thank you to JetBrains Academy for making this such a challenging step. >.<

The second of the four stages took me a week OwO, the rest just one day. Progress!!!
